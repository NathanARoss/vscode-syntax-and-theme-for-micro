# vscode-syntax-and-theme-for-micro
These config files are for this program.  https://micro-editor.github.io/

This repo contains modified a javascript .yaml syntax file, .micro theme file, and hex color codes for a Linux terminal emulator.

The javascript syntax file only serves to separate functions from other identifiers and control flow keywords from other keywords like VS Code does.  The theme file can be used with other file types.
